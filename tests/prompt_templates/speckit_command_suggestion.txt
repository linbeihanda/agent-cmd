Based on the following Claude Code response, suggest the most appropriate next spec-kit command to continue the development workflow:

Claude Code Response:
{claude_response}

Analyze the response and suggest one of these spec-kit commands:
- /speckit.specify - if the response contains new feature requirements or needs clarification
- /speckit.plan - if the response is ready for implementation planning
- /speckit.tasks - if the planning is complete and task generation is needed
- /speckit.implement - if tasks are ready for execution
- /speckit.clarify - if the response has ambiguities that need resolution

Respond with only the command, no explanation.
